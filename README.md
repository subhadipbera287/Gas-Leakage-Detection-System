# Intelligent Gas Leakage Detection and Safety System

This is an IoT-based embedded safety system using Arduino that detects gas leakage in real-time and activates both a buzzer and a fan, while sending an SMS alert using a GSM module.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- MQ2 Gas Sensor
- GSM Module (SIM800L)
- Relay Module
- Buzzer
- 12V Exhaust Fan

## 🛠 Features
- Gas leakage detection and threshold comparison
- Automatic exhaust fan activation
- SMS alert via GSM module
- Buzzer for local alerting

## 📁 Files Included
- `Gas_Leakage_Detection.ino` – Arduino code
- `Gas_Leakage_Detection_Report.docx` – Project write-up

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrate IoT dashboard (e.g., Blynk or ThingSpeak)
- Add LCD/LED display
- Cloud alerts or push notifications
